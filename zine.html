                <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
                <p class="artist-statement">The design idea behind this Zine was to find all the lost text in my house. I want to find the
                    oldest text I could, and I use it. Additionally, I wanted to commemorate some of the lost
                    family members I have and so I dedicated a page to them. I think the blurred look on the
                    obituaries and in memorandum cards shows that despite how much they were loved and
                    missed time fades their memories. There are handwritten notes from the oldest and
                    youngest family members. I love looking at signatures and have several signatures ranging
                    from professional signatures by an artist and a Naval Captain.
                    I feel this project means a lot to me as all the found text is from my families past or tied to
                    my lifeâ€™s journey and that this Zine hopefully will make people think of their families and
                    help them cherish the written artifacts that they have from their other family members.</p>
