                    <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
                    <p class="artist-statement">Sometimes we find the art we need to make when we try to make art, we thought we wanted to or should make. This video remix is a pivot, a move away from a piece that I am passionate about, but I was not able to distill the fine points I wanted to make in that video at this time.</p>
                    <p class="artist-statement">One of my passions is mountain biking and I always have some mountain biking videos in my feed. The opening line of The Ridge â€“ Danny Macaskill, "I always wondered if it would be possible for me to ride my mountain bike up there", hooked me and made me think of the hundreds of times I have looked out my car window. Thinking oh there is a line there and one there. My skill is significantly less than is required to ride these lines I form in my mind, but this opportunity gave me a chance to share what I feel it would be like to ride these raw challenge filed lines if I could ride them.</p>
                    <p class="artist-statement">Hope you enjoy!</p>
