                <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
                <p class="artist-statement">I chose BetterHelp as the subject of this Culture Jam assignment based on the large violation of trust by selling their user's personal information to companies to help target more users. This gives companies like Meta that have extraordinary capabilities for using big data to use information in a targeted way against their members for generating revenue. In my art piece, I tarnished the BetterHelp logo to reflect their current brand image. Then, matching fonts within the brand's identity, I made menu header and titles that were more realistic of their apparent goal and methods for achieving it. I warped the lower section of my image and exposed the black and white layer to illustrate the darker side the company works extremely hard to keep out of the publics eye.</p>
